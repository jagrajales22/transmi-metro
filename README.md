# transmi-metro
This project simulates the system of Transmi-metro, a transportation system with two main lines.

All schedules for car stops and passenger arrivals are read from .csv files. Passengers and cars are scheduled and then, a
simulation starts moving passengers to their respective buses from 0400 to 0000 hours.

ToDo Frontend part is pending. We will use observers at simulate() to refresh information as soon as it changes. Reports per 
station would be available to be downloaded clicking on every station name.
